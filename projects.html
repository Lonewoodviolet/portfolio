                                <p>As a team of one, I owned a feature of a music streaming service and collaborated with ML data scientists to solve a problem. The problem was low streaming counts for personalized songs despite renovation of the recommendation system.<br><br>
                                    I approached it qualitatively because we needed to understand "why" view counts weren't growing rather than just measuring them. Through heuristic evaluation, journey mapping, and usability testing, I identified that UI complexity was preventing users from discovering recommendations.<br><br>
                                    My insights led to interface simplification and recognition that users preferred familiar music in certain contexts. Follow-up quantitative research implementing these findings resulted in a 6% increase in streaming counts.</p>

                                <p>As a team of one, I owned a music streaming feature and collaborated with ML data scientists. The problem was twofold: proving how familiar songs affect user engagement and addressing data scientists' resistance to moving away from diversity as a solution for the "filter bubble".<br><br>
                                    I took a quantitative approach and reframed the topic as testing whether increased recommendation diversity, not familiarity, would improve engagement to overcome data scientists' skepticism.<br><br>
                                    Using A/B testing and log data analysis, I discovered increased diversity only attracted explorative users, not the majority, without significant changes in listening habits. Data scientists accepted my evidence-based suggestion to add a few familiar songs to playlist recommendations, resulting in a 6% increase in streaming counts, a key KPI.</p>

                                    I approached it with a dynamic mixed-methods framework and incorporated both existing data and fresh user perspectives for fast-paced, efficient collaboration. From triangulating analyses of behavioral log data, user scenario reviews, and user interviews, I suggested possible user journeys and iterated them with stakeholders to finalize CUJs.<br><br>
                                    The impact was successful integration into roadmap planning, company-wide recognition of CUJs' importance, and practical application in feature prioritization decisions.</p>

                                <p>As a UX research lead in an early startup, I cross-functionally collaborated with technical stakeholders to develop a web product for diagnosing AI dataset quality. The challenge was creating a user-friendly MVP for a highly technical product with limited market benchmarks.<br><br>
                                    Starting with a simple prototype, I employed a generative research approach using qualitative methods. First, I established stakeholders' consensus on UX by democratizing the research process. Then, I defined target user groups and critical product features with leadership. Through in-depth interviews and analysis, I developed comprehensive user scenarios that informed the product's design iterations and validated them with usability testing.<br><br>
                                    This collaborative approach led to a successful product launch at CES 2024 and secured partnerships with major industry players, establishing clear UX strategies for future product plans.</p>
